When the 50-year-old policies and entrenched injustices of apartheid were finally overthrown in 1994, Nelson Mandela’s new government began rebuilding a nation badly in need of racial unity. So the world was watching when South Africa played host to the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Though they had only one non-white player, the South African Springboks gained supporters of all colors as they made an improbable run into the final match where they beat the heavily favored New Zealand team. When Mandela himself marched to the center of the pitch cloaked in a Springbok jersey and shook hands with the captain of the South African team, two nations became one. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman and director Cliff Bestall will tell the emotional story of that cornerstone moment and what it meant to South Africa’s healing process.","popularity":1.526,"poster_path":"/hQPwbCjWEDuzf7PCQwnaHDbJroT.jpg","release_date":"2010-05-04","title":"The 16th Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":10,"credit_id":"5ef928cba284eb0038911cf8","department":"Production","job":"Producer","media_type":"movie"},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/5C6njaciKvyZlKWUrQX7mjdl4D1.jpg","genre_ids":[80,9648,53,28],"id":2043,"original_language":"en","original_title":"Along Came a Spider","overview":"After the harrowing death of his partner, detective and best-selling author Alex Cross has retreated to the peace of retirement.
