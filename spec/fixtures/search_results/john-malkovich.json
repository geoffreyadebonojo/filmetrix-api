Recollecting their past home, which now exists only in old VHS tapes, Luka and Željko take a trip down memory lane, while also setting out on a path to discovering what the future holds for them. As they connect the dots of their family tree, a mash-up of very different characters is introduced, including a book-van librarian, an old farmer, a John Malkovich double from Croatia, and people from all over the world whose last name is Malković. But, digging up one’s family history always carries a certain risk – will father and son lose their relationship while trying to improve it?",
